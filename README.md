- [my ludum dare entry, adapted for **ktg**](https://ericoporto.github.io/rocambolli/)

# how to use
First, add to your html document:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="ktg.js"></script>

Before using, you need to declare at some place:

    ktg.setup()

Whenever a key is pressed ktg_KeyPressed event is emitted, and when it's released,
ktg_KeyReleased is emitted. You can use event listeners on the window element.

    window.addEventListener('ktg_KeyReleased',  writeKeyUp,false);
    window.addEventListener('ktg_KeyPressed', writeKeyDown,false);

The key is passed as string under `event.detail` .

Alternatively you can monitor the keys under your gameloop using `isPressed`.

    if( ktg.isPressed(ktg.key.UP) ) {
      ...
    }

The possible keys by default are:

    ktg.key.LEFT
    ktg.key.UP
    ktg.key.RIGHT
    ktg.key.DOWN
    ktg.key.BUTTONA
    ktg.key.BUTTONB
    ktg.key.BUTTONX
    ktg.key.BUTTONY
  }

## ktg.setup details

ktg.setup accepts three parameters:

- `autoupdategamepad` : set this to `false` if you want to place your gamepad
update in your own loop, to ensure better precision. You will need to manually
call ktg.updateGamepad(). Default is `true`.

- `drawtouch` : set to `false`if you don't need the touch input functionality,
for example, if you detect that your game is in a desktop. Default is `true`.

- `autoresize` : set to `false`if you don't need the on screen touch input to
autoresize itself, for example, on orientation change (portrait to landscape in
a phone). You can call ktg.resize manually if autoresize is `false`. Default is
`true`.

Ex:

`ktg.setup(true, true, true)`

is the same as

`ktg.setup()`

## ktg.resize details

In case your game resizes, for example, by resizing the browser window, or going
fullscreen, you will need to deal with this - assuming you set autoresize to
`false`. When you deal, just ensure to call `ktg.resize()` to guarantee it will
resize the touch input appropriately.
